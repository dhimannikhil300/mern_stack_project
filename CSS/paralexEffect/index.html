            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that involves flying through the air using a fabric wing and harness. Here are some key points to know about paragliding:
                <br><br><br>
                What is Paragliding?
                </br>
                Paragliding involves launching oneself off a slope or from a moderate height using a fabric wing (paraglider) to glide through the air. It's often considered a form of free-flight, relying on wind and thermals for lift.
                <br><br>
                How Does it Work?
                <br>
                A paraglider wing resembles a ram-air parachute and is made of rip-stop nylon. It's inflated by running or by wind entering the wing's openings. The pilot is suspended in a harness beneath the wing.

                Where Can You Paraglide?
                <br>
                Paragliding can be done in various terrains, including mountainsides, hills, or coastal cliffs. Popular locations include Interlaken in Switzerland, Queenstown in New Zealand, and Oludeniz in Turkey, among others.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a water sport that involves riding waves on a board, typically while standing up. It originated in ancient Polynesia and gained popularity in the 20th century, becoming a global phenomenon. Surfers use specially designed boards to catch and ride ocean waves, utilizing a variety of techniques to maneuver across the water.
                <br><br>
                The sport requires balance, strength, and an understanding of the ocean's dynamics. Surfers often spend hours waiting for the perfect wave, known as the "lineup," and then paddle vigorously to catch it at the right moment. Once riding the wave, they use their body and the board to navigate and perform various tricks and turns.
